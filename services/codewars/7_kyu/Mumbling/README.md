# Mumbling

This time no story, no theory. The examples below show you how to write function accum:


## Examples:

```
accum("abcd") -> "A-Bb-Ccc-Dddd"
accum("RqaEzty") -> "R-Qq-Aaa-Eeee-Zzzzz-Tttttt-Yyyyyyy"
accum("cwAt") -> "C-Ww-Aaa-Tttt"
```

The parameter of accum is a string which includes only letters from ```a..z``` and ```A..Z```.
