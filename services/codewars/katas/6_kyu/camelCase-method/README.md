# CamelCase Method

Write simple .camelCase method (camel_case function in PHP, CamelCase in C# or camelCase in Java) for strings. All words
must have their first letter capitalized without spaces.

For instance:

```
CamelCase("hello case")      // => "HelloCase"
CamelCase("camel case word") // => "CamelCaseWord"
```
